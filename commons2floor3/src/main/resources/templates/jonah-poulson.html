                <h3>About Jonah Poulson</h3>
                <p>Hi, My name is Jonah Poulson and yeah, that orangish/yellow hair you probably saw earlier is not my natural hair color, SHOCKER!!!!! All jokes aside, I am going to be a senior this year and I am currently studying Information Technology with a focus in Web and Mobile Programming. A common pattern for a lot of people is to spend their junior and senior year off campus and just kind of cross that finish line. But that is not the case for me, I want my senior year to be the best year I’ve had yet, which is a bar that is set high but you know, with God all things are possible. Seriously though, I want to leave my senior year with an absolute bang, not just cross that finish line but absolutely destroy it.</p>

                <h3>Jonah's testimony</h3>
                <p>So my testimony, wow, God has worked so much in my life that I could probably write a book lol, but I’ll keep this short. So I grew up in a Christian home but I always lived this worldly life and that got pretty crazy once I got to highschool. Long story short I was a student athlete and fit into you know, the cool crowd. And with that was a bunch of partying, and I’m going to be honest with you that included a good amount of drinking and smoking weed. Fast-forward, One day, a good friend of mine invited me to a Bible study and I was like “sure, I’m a Christian” and there was a guy named Wolf who was my friends youth pastor and he wanted to follow up with me, he took me to Starbucks and it was there where he taught me to read the Bible for myself and took me under his wing and showed me what it meant to follow Jesus. It wasn’t just that one meeting, he continued to follow up with me week after week teaching me the Bible and I eventually joined his church and became actively involved, then that leads to college, other things and yeah. If there is one thing I want you to take away from this testimony it’s that intentionality can make a huge difference, I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for a man who loved Jesus and was intentional about spending his time to share the gospel with me and train me in discipleship. Anyways I am super excited for this year and if you guys ever want to talk, need advice or just need someone to listen to you, I’m just a call (or text) away.</p>
