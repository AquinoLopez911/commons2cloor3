            "intro" : "HELLO! My name is Emily Clubb and I am going to be one of your RAs! I lived on 2-3 last year as a CGL so I am a returner to the hall (which I think is pretty neat!) I am from Columbus, Ohio where I live with my parents and two foster siblings while my older sister lives in South Carolina. I love being outside and exploring nature, especially if it involves water (BIG lake girl). I love earrings & nail polish (probably a little too much). I love to listen to music in the car as well as have crazy dance parties. My favorite food is probably cinnamon rolls or a bagel paired with an iced coffee. One cool fact about me is that I am a first generation American and have dual citizenship with the US and Canada! Many people tell me I‚Äôm intimidating but I promise I‚Äôm really just a goofball once you get to know me and I love hugs!! If you are looking for me at Liberty, you will most likely find me in the library. I pretty much live there. Can‚Äôt wait to meet everyone!!",

            "description" : "I became a Christian when I was a freshman in high school. Throughout middle school I was part of a friend group that was super exclusive and very two faced. I was super nice to your face and would only get to know people on a surface level while when I was only with my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù we thought we were better than others. When I got to high school, I began to feel bad about mistreating people and my older sister invited me to a YoungLife event. I continued to go to YoungLife and at a weekend camp, I heard the gospel in a new light and gave my life to Christ. From that point on, I began to change the way I acted and treated people, through being mentored by a girl at my church. My mentor taught me how to love others and how to live as a woman of God. My friends noticed how I was changing and completely ghosted me. I went through a time where I had no real friends so I started to get plugged into a youth group and serving at my church and into YoungLife at my school and found true fellowship. Since becoming a Christian, I have become a huge advocate for inclusion because I know what it‚Äôs like to exclude people as well as be the one with no friends. Neither are good feelings. In the last five and a half years of being a Christian, I have grown in my faith tremendously as well as made mistakes (ask me about them yikes) that forced me to learn I need to constantly be in pursuit of becoming more like Christ. I am super excited to continue to grow this year as an RA and hopefully use my testimony and lessons learned to showcase Christ on our hall and to help inspire others to lean into God."
