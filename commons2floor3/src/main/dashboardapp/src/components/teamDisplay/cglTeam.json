I have always been a little bit of an introvert but in middle and high school, worldly living put me into a cycle of bad mental health and worldly habits. I knew the way I was living was wrong, but I had no real desire to change. I knew just enough salvation doctrine to be dangerous. I knew doctrinally speaking, I didn’t believe a person could lose their salvation. So, I thought it was alright to continue living the way I was. (Boy was I wrong. Hopefully, I don’t need to point out the fallacy in my thinking!) There were days in school that I would not speak to anyone: eat, sleep, and school was all I did. This continued for many years. Freshman year of college was a wakeup call for me, being away from home brought my sin habits and mental health to a breaking point. Combine that with a major I was not enjoying, and you get a recipe for disaster. This is when I did something that was probably rash and not well thought out, I enlisted in the US Army (Va National Guard to be specific). looking back, that was definitely where God wanted me to be though. So, I put my life on pause for six months and went to Initial Entry Training at Fort Jackson SC, and JEB Little Creek. I disenrolled from LU for a year and shipped out on June 25, 2018. Basic training was rough, but it was exactly what I needed. Six months of separation from the world forced me to really draw close to God for the first time in my life. I left training a different person, I learned how to lean on God for strength. By merely having an intimate relationship with Jesus I found hope and happiness I didn’t have before. Depression is a buzzword I don’t like to use, but my former life was not what God had intended for me. Last year, my sophomore year, was my first year back after my hiatus. I still didn’t know what God wanted for me to do as a career and I stubbornly insisted on doing something where I could make a lot of money (pre-med, engineering). But fall semester last year God got a hold of my life and I fully surrendered everything to Him. It was then that I began feeling the call towards vocational ministry! Although it’s too early to say where God wants me, I am seriously considering becoming a Chaplain for the Army! (as I said, I don’t think it’s an accident I ended up in the Army!) Throughout my life, I have seen God take a broken boy living in the world without hope and transform him into someone who is not perfect but is continually seeking him. Now I have hope and Joy in Him and for Him."

Long story short I was a student athlete and fit into you know, the cool crowd. And with that was a bunch of partying, and I’m going to be honest with you that included a good amount of drinking and smoking weed. Fast-forward, One day, a good friend of mine invited me to a Bible study and I was like “sure, I’m a Christian” and there was a guy named Wolf who was my friends youth pastor and he wanted to follow up with me, he took me to Starbucks and it was there where he taught me to read the Bible for myself and took me under his wing and showed me what it meant to follow Jesus. It wasn’t just that one meeting, he continued to follow up with me week after week teaching me the Bible and I eventually joined his church and became actively involved, then that leads to college, other things and yeah. If there is one thing I want you to take away from this testimony it’s that intentionality can make a huge difference, I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for a man who loved Jesus and was intentional about spending his time to share the gospel with me and train me in discipleship. Anyways I am super excited for this year and if you guys ever want to talk, need advice or just need someone to listen to you, I’m just a call (or text) away."
