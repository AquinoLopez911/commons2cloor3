I love doing anything outdoors, especially hiking, shooting, and sports. I could talk about cars all day and love anything to do with them. I have played drums for over 10 years and it is one of my favorite hobbies. Drums have given me many great opportunities for traveling and ministry and I plan to continue that for as long as I can. I want this hall to be a tight nit group with no outsiders. I understand that everyone is going to have their “people”, but no one should ever feel like they do not belong. If we can do this, we are going to have an amazing year.",

I have felt the overwhelming grace of God in my life and have lots of stories I can tell about how he has been faithful to me. My walk with God is what has made me who I am, without putting my trust in him and letting him guide my life I would not be here on this campus with you all right now. I could go on and on about how he has showed up in my life, but come ask me and find out for yourself!"

            "description" : "When I was seven years old my mom told me a story in the Bible about when a sinful lady threw herself at Jesus’ feet in a Pharisee’s house and cried in repentance of her sins. Jesus saw her heart and her faith and forgave her and told her to go and sin no more. The Holy Spirit convicted me in that moment and I went into another room and asked Jesus to forgive me and make me new. Since that day, I have known the love of Jesus personally and can testify to His faithfulness! I am not perfect and my life has not been the easiest, but I am here to serve each of you this year and am so so excited to form new relationships and see how God molds us to look more like him together! Feel free to reach out to me at anytime for anything! I know me and the rest of our hall’s leadership are so excited to meet each of you and help y’all with anything you may need!"

A little bit about me, I’ve grown up in Lancaster county PA (Home of the Amish) for a majority of my life. I enjoy hunting, fishing, hiking, sports and pretty much anything outside but am always up for a good movie night with pizza and breadsticks (necessity of any good movie night). My favorite thing about college so far has been many of the late night, both crazy and deep conversations I’ve been able to have both on and off the hall! My biggest ministry has been dedicated to striving after and creating a strong brotherhood among the guys on our hall as a support system no matter where we are in life. If you have any questions or want to connect more id love to talk with you and cannot wait to meet up with you in person next year!",

            "description" : "Ive been blessed to grow up in a christian family and have attended church regularly my whole life. I dedicated my life to Christ when I was 5 after hearing a sermon on what christ did and had to sacrifice to save me from my sins. Yet till college I lived a fairly legalistic life on the coattails of my parents faith but quite literally missed out on what It truly meant to be an adopted son of God. After my first year at liberty I really started to go astray in many different areas of my life without my parents faith to hang onto. In my second year though I really began to fully understand what a relationship with Christ truly means and was able to begin surrounding myself with christians who began to fire up my faith. The best way to describe my testimony was a quote i recently heard from a mentor of mine at Liberty. When I first committed my life to Christ I somewhat consider it to be like having fire insurance. But in my second year at Liberty it may sound cheesy but I’ve become more of a firefighter in my faith passionately pursuing a relationship with christ rather than sitting by contently doing nothing to pursue the lord. I cannot wait to see what will happen on our hall next year!"

This will be my first year in my masters program here at LU and I am studying clinical and mental health counseling. I was an RS on Commons 2 Floor 5 last year and it was seriously one of the best experiences. I am so so excited to get to do it again on floor 3!! I was a figure skater for ten years and I competed with Liberty’s synchronized skating team for my first two years at school. I absolutely love music and being outside and I can’t wait to have tons of fun hall events and get to know everyone on our floor!!",

I was baptized when I was ten years old but my relationship with Christ really became my own when I got to Liberty. It has been incredible to see the way the Lord has shaped me and how He continues to grow me everyday. I am passionate about ministry and I am so grateful to get to serve in the role of RS."
